        About Predictor:
      </h3>
      <h5 class="h5">
        This Application gives you the Probability of being affected by Lung Cancer by examining the symptoms. You need to fill the
        form in the home page and then you will be provided with the Probability of Infection. Also, if your percentage of infection is high then please consider
        consulting a Medical Specialist for better advices.

        Requirement of this Predictor:
      </h3>
      <h5 class="h5">
        As we know that the growing cases of Lung Cancer have affected lives of many people. Early diagnosis of this disease can be very helpful to the affected people. This Predictor aims to reduce the cases of Lung Cancer by diagnosing it in an early stage.

        My Idea for this Predictor:
      </h3>
      <h5 class="h5">
        The idea of my project is that a set of doctors should sit and discuss about the mostly seen symptoms of Lung Cancer such as Blood Cough, Difficulty in Breathing, Chest Pain etc. They should make a complete data set by
        testing the symptoms of those people who have been tested with Lung Cancer. After that we can work on
        that data and create a ML Model for better predictions. Then according to that prediction, we should test the people and diagnose the disease at an early stage.

          Note: This model is not ready to use. It is based on random data. It needs to be trained using actual data.

        My Solution:
      </h3>
      <h5 class="h5">
        I have actually made a Website which is kind of a form that the people need to fill for
        themselves to be clarified that they require being diagnosed or not. The data I am using is completely random but for this model to be used we need to
        get actual data which will be provided by a set of healthcare specialists.

        Working of this App:
      </h3>
      <h5 class="h5">
        This model is trained on the Logistic Regression Algorithm of a Python Library called Scikit Learn. The model is
        trained with Random Data generated using MS Excel and stored in an Comma Separated File(CSV). Then the model predicts according
        to the inputs of the user.
